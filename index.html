            <h2 id="mainHeading">My Gaming Past</h2>
            <p class="paras">I have always enjoyed playing computer games. I remember playing MS-DOS games as a young child. This started my interest in technology and programming. I love working with computers and continue to enjoy playing computer games in my free time. Take a look at my three favorite games!</p>

            <h2 class="titles">Tribes 2</h2>
            <p class="paras">Tribes 2 was one of the first multiplayer games that I experienced. I remember playing Tribes 2 alongside other classics such as Unreal Tournament and Quake. Tribes 2 was developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra On-Line. The gameplay primarily focused on multiplayer combat with up to 128 players. The game types included capture the flag, deathmatch, and arena. The modding community also added a variety of maps, game types, and other content. This was before DLC and other restrictions began to limit the creativity of modders and gaming communities. The movement was unique, including a jetpack to unlock the z-axis. Players were able to jet through the air and ski across the landscape, gliding down hills and building up speed. The variety of movement and combat options allowed for many different play styles. The community had a number of competitive teams, and you could always find a group to play with. Tribes 2 is my favorite game of all time.</p>

            <h2 class="titles">Global Agenda</h2>
            <p class="paras">Global Agenda was developed and published by Hi-Rez Studios. They are also the creators of Smite and Paladins. As the Tribes 2 community began to dwindle in size, I began looking for another competitive game to branch into. After testing the waters with several other similar games, I found the Global Agenda community. The game itself was not as fast paced as Tribes 2, but it did include the z-axis with jetpacks. The game included a mix of PVE and PVP game modes. One of the primary PVP game modes was called Agency vs Agency. Organized groups of players raided against each other, competing for resources and territory. The seasons were 2 weeks long and required coordination between 20-30 members. I enjoyed leading and managing an Agency, as well as the competition between different player groups. Hi-Rez abandoned the game in 2018 and shut the servers down. No sequel is planned.</p>

            <h2 class="titles">Minecraft</h2>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I have heard Minecraft described as computer legos, you can build anything in this game. Minecraft was developed and published by Mojang. The game is an open world survival game. You discover resources and craft many different items. The game can also be modified and customized. I have continued to play Minecraft off and on since it was released in 2011. The game has endless creative possibilities. Modders continue to generate new content and adventures. The base game also continues to receive updates. It has been 10 years, and new content is always available! I love the fact that you can host a server for yourself and your friends. I have enjoyed learning how to host and maintain a simple Minecraft server, and it taught me a lot along the way. Playing with your friends makes Minecraft twice as fun.</p>

            <h3 class="titles">Summary</h3>
            <p class="paras">I have played many computer games throughout my life. These are the three games that left the biggest impact on me personally. I still enjoy playing a variety of games, but I am always looking for something similar to the Tribes 2 PVP experience. Maybe someday we will see the return of capture the flag!</p>
